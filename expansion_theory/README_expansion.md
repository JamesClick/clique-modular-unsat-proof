# Modular UNSAT â€“ Theoretical Expansion

This folder contains the ongoing scientific expansion of the Modular Signature Conjecture.

## Objectives

- Explore deeper theoretical formulations of the signature method
- Test a wider variety of CNF formulas (PHP, Tseitin, XOR-SAT, Random 3-SAT)
- Compare the influence of weight schemes and modulus size
- Investigate performance, robustness, and potential algebraic proofs

## Files

- `draft_v2.tex`: LaTeX file with the initial structure of the theoretical article (v2)
- `notas_formais.txt`: Informal notes about logical structure and conjecture
- `residuos_extended.csv`: Extended dataset with modular residues and satisfiability labels
